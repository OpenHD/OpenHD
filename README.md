Welcome to OpenHD! This project uses ordinary wifi in a way that replicates the good characteristics of analog radio. We are transmitting and receiving HD video, telemetry, audio, and control data all in one solution. Our primary user group is FPV UAV users. As such the display/receiver side also includes a very full featured OSD. This is also augmented by an optional android app that connects to the system and facilitates settings changes.  

This repository is one of three which form the foundation of the project. The other two are the Image Builder (https://github.com/HD-Fpv/Open.HD_Image_Builder) and the Android App (https://github.com/HD-Fpv/Open.HD_AndroidApp). The Image Builder allows the creation and modification of the OpenHD image from the kernel level all the way up. We also offer pre-built images that you can directly download. Look around, read up the wiki (https://github.com/HD-Fpv/Open.HD/wiki), ask questions on RCgroups.com or Zulip (https://open-hd.zulipchat.com), and contribute back!
