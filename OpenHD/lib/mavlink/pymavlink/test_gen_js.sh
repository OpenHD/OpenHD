# NextGen node/javascript top-level bindings test/s  - there are a few stages of test here..

# 1. ensure we've got the dependencies pre-built, such as js bindings, C bindings, and minimal compiled c targets.
# 2. run the static pre-canned JS create/pack tests in the 'mavlink.tests.js' files (ie assembling packets for sending)
# 3. capture all the packets that the C bindings test suite make, and try to parse them all with JS. ( incoming packet parsing)
# 4. make and run the complete autogenerated 'mocha' test suite/s that does byte-level verification of JS against the C bindings.

# We use '.tests.js' autogenerated javascript to build/pack one of each packet with test data for nominally sending

# utilise the C bindings and test suite to generate a bunch of mavlink data that we can run through the node/javascript parser
# we do this by executing ./generator/C/test/posix/testmav2.0_ardupilotmega to 
# run mavlink_test_all() from generator/C/include_v2.0/ardupilotmega/testsuite.h

# this script can be called manually by a human, or it can be triggered by a 'npm test' from the generator/javascript/ folder, so we handle either.
