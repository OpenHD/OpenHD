mavlink_message_lengths_dict = OrderedDict([

(                               'HEARTBEAT' ,  17), # ID#000 The heartbeat message shows that a system is present and responding. The type of the MAV and Autopilot hardware allow the receiving system to treat further messages from this system appropriate (e.g. by laying out the user interface based on the autopilot).
(                              'SYS_STATUS' ,  39), # ID#001 The general system state. If the system is following the MAVLink standard, the system state is mainly defined by three orthogonal states/modes: The system mode, which is either LOCKED (motors shut down and locked), MANUAL (system under RC control), GUIDED (system with autonomous position control, position setpoint controlled manually) or AUTO (system guided by path/waypoint planner). The NAV_MODE defined the current flight state: LIFTOFF (often an open-loop maneuver), LANDING, WAYPOINTS or VECTOR. This represents the internal navigation state machine. The system status shows whether the system is currently active or not and if an emergency occurred. During the CRITICAL and EMERGENCY states the MAV is still considered to be active, but should start emergency procedures autonomously. After a failure occurred it should first move from active to critical to allow manual intervention and then move to emergency after a certain timeout.

The position is set automatically by the system during the takeoff in case it was not explicitly set by the operator before or after. The position the system will return to and land on. The global and local positions encode the position in the respective coordinate frames, while the q parameter encodes the orientation of the surface. Under normal conditions it describes the heading and terrain slope, which can be used by the aircraft to adjust the approach. The approach 3D vector describes the point to which the system should fly in normal flight mode and then perform a landing sequence along the vector.
