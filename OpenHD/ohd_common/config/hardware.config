# On openhd images, it is placed under "/boot/openhd/hardware.config" -

[camera]

# or debug / develop camera(s) that are not fully integrated yet.

# Use 1 if you only use a primary camera (CAM0), use 2 if you use a primary and secondary camera (CAM0 and CAM1)
CAMERA_N_CAMERAS = 1
# Available camera types are:
# 1) DUMMY_SW :
# a camera emulated fully in sw, usefully for development and debugging
# 2) CUSTOM_UNMANAGED_CAMERA
# This camera is for developing purposes and/or for users that want to create more or less esoteric camera pipelines, e.g. by using
# a custom script. In this mode, ohd_video acts as a completely agnostic passthrough for a camera stream that is neither managed
# by openhd main executable nor created by openhd main executable (note: by that you loose any openhd-provided functionalities,
# e.g. changing camera settings and/or parameters.
# To keep this API somewhat stable we only define the following:
# Data needs to be provided by feeding h264,h265 or mjpeg encapsulated in RTP to udp port localhost::5500 in case of primary camera and
# localhost::5501 in case of secondary camera
# In case any of the 2 cameras (primary or secondary) is set to custom unmanaged, the custom_unmanaged_camera.service is automatically
# started at boot (and executes whatever is written in the custom_unmanaged_camera.sh script in /boot/openhd/scripts/).
# Read the script to get you started how a camera pipeline might look like (e.g. for ip cam).
# Other options:
# Auto-detectable cameras. When CAMERA_ENABLE_AUTODETECT=false, they need to be explicitly specified !!! )
# OpenHD will wait for them to become available at boot

[network]
# OpenHD can control the ethernet connection via mavlink (wrapping network manager) but that only really serves a purpose on rpi as a ground station

# 2) The interface name of your ethernet card otherwise, e.g. eth0
