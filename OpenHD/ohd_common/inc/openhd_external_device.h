// 1) What are external device(s): A smartphone, tablet or similar connected via (WIFI,USB Tethering) to
//    the ground unit
// 2) How are these device(s) handled: Once detected (e.g. when a USB tethering connection is detected), find their IP adress,
//    then call the callback function with the ip and connected==true when new device connected, as well as connected==false
//    when this device disconnects
// 3) How are these device(s) detected: Right now in oh_interface by usb, ethernet listeners and in ohd_telemetry by the mavlink
//    tcp endpoint.
