// Mavlink Endpoint
// A Mavlink endpoint hides away the underlying connection - e.g. UART, TCP, WB.
// It has a (implementation-specific) method to send messages (sendMessage) and (implementation-specific)
// continuously forwards new incoming messages via a callback.
// It MUST also hide away any problems that could exist with this endpoint - e.g. a disconnecting UART.
// If (for example) in case of UART the connection is lost, it should just try to reconnect
// and as soon as the connection has been re-established, continue working as if nothing happened.
// This "send/receive data when possible, otherwise do nothing" behaviour fits well with the mavlink paradigm:
// https://mavlink.io/en/services/heartbeat.html
// "A component is considered to be connected to the network if its HEARTBEAT message is regularly received, and disconnected if a number of expected messages are not received."
// => A endpoint is considered alive it has received any mavlink messages in the last X seconds.
