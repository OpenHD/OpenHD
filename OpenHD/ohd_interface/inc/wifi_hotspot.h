/**
 * Wifi hotspot refers to creating a WiFi Access point on the device we are running on.
 * External clients like QOpenHD running on a tablet can then connect to the hotspot.
 * Note that auto video and telemetry forwarding is not implemented for WiFi hotspot -
 * On the one hand, this is prone to errors anyways, on the other hand, it is hard to do to actively search for connected devices and their IPs.
 * TCP mavlink (perhaps also video in the future) is the way to go here.
 * Change Nov4 2022: Uses network manager - we already have network manager installed and enabled by default on the rpi on the openhd images,
 * but the default raspbian images from pi foundation have it only installed, but disabled by default (they'l use it eventually)
