/**
 * USB hotspot (USB Tethering).
 * Since the USB tethering is always initiated by the user (when he switches USB Tethering on on his phone/tablet)
 * we don't need any settings or similar, and checking once every second barely uses any CPU resources.
 * This was created by translating the tether_functions.sh script from wifibroadcast-scripts into c++.
 * This class configures and forwards the connect and disconnect event(s) for a USB tethering device, such that
 * we can start/stop forwarding to the device's ip address.
 * Only supports one USB tethering device connected at the same time.
 * Also, assumes that the usb tethering device always shows up under /sys/class/net/usb0.
 * Note that we do not have to perform any setup action(s) here - network manager does that for us
 * We really only listen to the event's device connected / device disconnected and forward them.
