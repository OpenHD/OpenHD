/**
 * Every camera stream should inherit from this class.
 * This hides away the underlying implementation (for example gstreamer,...) for
 * different platform(s). The paradigms developers should aim for with each
 * camera stream are:
 * 1) Once an instance is created, it will start generating video data, already encoded and packetized with respect to the link MTU.
 * RTP MUST be used for packetization (at least for now)
 * 2) If the camera disconnects or the underlying process crashes (for whatever reason) the underlying
 * implementation should re-start the camera and encoding process
 * 3) If the user changes camera parameters, it should store these changes locally (such that
 * they are also set after the next re-start) and apply the changes. It is no
 * problem to just restart the underlying camera/encoding process with the new
 * parameters.
 * 4) The implementation(s) should handle the differences between camera(s) in regards to supported and not supported parameters
 *
 * Video streaming in OpenHD is always unidirectional and lossy (FEC). However, this is done by the link implementation - here we only
 * generate encoded data and packetize it into rtp fragments, then forward it.
