Here I collect code that once came from 'some github repository' and should not be modified.
Only maybe 'Updated' when these repositories receive updates
Also, all this code is written in 'c' not 'c++'

30.Jan 2021:
The sources from "zfec" are not used anymore (https://github.com/tahoe-lafs/zfec/tree/master/zfec)
The fec stuff was copied from
https://github.com/OpenHD/Open.HD/blob/8f7be98a3b7c97f325ae655256c81bea09199834/wifibroadcast-base/fec.c
and the syntax was improved slightly (make const when dealing with buffers data is not written to)

The "radiotap stuff" comes from https://github.com/radiotap/radiotap-library
