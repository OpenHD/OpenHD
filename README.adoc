== Welcome to OpenHD!

OpenHD uses off-the-shelf Wi-Fi adapters available for purchase online. However, it is not standard Wi-Fi, which is unsuitable for low-latency
or very long-distance transmission. Instead, OpenHD configures the Wi-Fi adapter in a way that is closer to a simple broadcast, much like analog
video transmission hardware you may be using already.

High-definition video, 2-way UAV telemetry, audio, and RC control signals can all be sent over a single transmission channel.

A multi-platform Open.HD app is available for live video with a customizable OSD.

TIP: Look around, read the {wiki}, ask questions on {telegram} or {discord}!
